She changes outfits, sunbathes on the beach, spends time with other Barbies, the day ends with a raucous dance party, 
and in all this positive glittery mess, Ken's lover is just an appendage to Barbie. 
One day the doll is visited by thoughts of death, and her made to fit shoes with heels, her feet suddenly become flat. 
In order to understand what is happening and to return the usual plastic world, Barbie has to go to the real world and find her hostess. 
She is followed by Ken, who can't imagine life without his idol.#
